# Gaelic Football
[Gaelic Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football) is an Irish sport that I have played since I was 5 years old. Currently, I am a member of Dunedin Connolys, the local team in Edinburgh.

# Running
I enjoy running in my spare time. I have completed one marathon, a handful of half marathons and one trail run at the half marathon distance.
