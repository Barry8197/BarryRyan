## About Me
My name is Barry Ryan. I am an early career researcher pursuing my PhD at the University of Edinburgh. I come from Cork, Ireland where I lived until moving to Edinburgh, UK where I currently live. I enjoy using data science and artificial intelligence to obtain insights into complex biological datasets. My current research looks at representing genomic data as networks and using graph neural network algorithm to perform insightful classifications. 

My research interests are : 
- Networks
- Network Biology
- Graph Neural Networks
- Multi-Modal Data Integration
- Genomic Datasets

## Highlights
### New pre-print | Jan '25
New pre-print submitted to ISMB'25. See [Publications](./publications.md) for more info.

### Data Scientist with Optima Partners | Dec '24
For the previous few months I have enjoyed working part-time with Bioxcelerate AI, the healthcare focused division of Optima Partners. It's given me a great insight into industry and I enjoiyed it very much.

### Publication of MOGDx in Bioinformatics | Aug '24
I've had my first solo first author publication in [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae523). It's been more than two years in the making and hopefully a good sign for more to come. 

### Presentation at Machine Learning in Science Conference | Aug '24
Really enjoyed presenting my work on Parkinson's Disease at the MLiS conference in Glasgow. Had some really interesting questions about identifying subpopulations in PD and discussing the predictive accuracy when using genomic datasets for homogenous disease populations with genetic effects.

### Workshop and Presentation at ISMB | July '24
Had a fantastic trip to hashtag#ISMB24 in Montreal. Alongside Sebesty√©n Kamp, Ian Simpson, Chaeeun Lee and Hanane Issa, we presented a full day introductory workshop on 'Modelling Multi-Modal Biomedical Data Using Networks'. Personally, teaching material related to my PhD was a great way to see the progress I've made over the last 3 years and very rewarding to share this knowledge with others. 

The materials can be found at this [link](https://biomedicalai.inf.ed.ac.uk/book/intro.html)

I also had the opportunity to present a poster on a recent preprint titled 'An Integrative Approach for Longitudinal Classification in Parkinson's Disease'. Click <a href="/barryryan/mydocs/Ryan_CDT_Poster.pdf">here</a> to view the poster. 

### Presentation at Conference in AI For Health (CAI4H) | May '24
Had the opportunity to give a 10 min talk explaining my project "An Integrative Network Approach for Longitudinal Stratification in Parkinson's Disease" at the CAI4H conference in Edinburgh. 

### Interview for #GettingGenomeMe | March '24
[Link](https://onehealthgenomics.ed.ac.uk/barry-ryan) to an interview I performed with One Health Genomics in Edinburgh as part of their GettingGenomeSeries.

### Edinburgh Next Generation of Genomics Symposium (ENGoGS) | November '23
Awarded best presentation at the ENGoGS conference. 

### Poster Presentation at Intelligent Systmes for Molecular Biology (ISMB) | July '23
Was selected to present a poster at the international ISMB conference in Lyon. Click <a href="/barryryan/mydocs/barry_ismb_poster.pdf">here</a> to view the poster.
